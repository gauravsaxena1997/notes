	<p>Django's primary goal is to ease the creation of complex, database-driven websites. Django emphasizes reusability of components, rapid development, and the principle of don't repeat yourself.</p>
	<p>Also included in the core framework are: </p>
	<p>- a lightweight and standalone web server for development and testing</p>
	<p>- a form serialization and validation system that can translate between HTML forms and values suitable for storage in the database. </p>
	<p>- a template system that utilizes the concept of inheritance borrowed from object-oriented programming</p>

	<p>The Model-View-Template (MVT) is slightly different from MVC. In fact the main difference between the two patterns is that Django itself takes care of the Controller part (Software Code that controls the interactions between the Model and View), leaving us with the template. The template is a HTML file mixed with Django Template Language (DTL).</p>

	<p>It provides a software framework for distributed storage and processing of big data. Originally designed for computer clusters.</p>
	<p>The core of Apache Hadoop consists of a storage part, known as Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), and a processing part which is a MapReduce programming model.</p>
	<p>Hadoop splits files into blocks and distributes them across nodes in a cluster. It then transfers packaged code into nodes to process the data in parallel.</p>

	<p>Originally developed at the University of California, Berkeley's AMPLab, the Spark codebase was later donated to the Apache Software Foundation, which has maintained it since.</p>
	<p>Apache Spark has the resilient distributed dataset (RDD) as its architectural foundation , a read-only multiset of data items distributed over a cluster of machines</p>
	<p>In Spark 1.x, the RDD was the primary application programming interface (API)</p>
	<p>Spark 2.x use of the Dataset API is encouraged, The RDD technology still underlies the Dataset API.</p>
	<p><b>Components: </b></p>
	<p><b>Spark SQL:</b> Spark SQL is a component on top of Spark Core that introduced a data abstraction called DataFrames,which provides support for structured and semi-structured data. </p>

	<p>RDDs are immutable and their operations are lazy; fault-tolerance is achieved by keeping track of the "lineage" of each RDD (the sequence of operations that produced it) so that it can be reconstructed in the case of data loss. </p>
	<h5>MapReduce</h5>

<h5>Database index</h5>
<p>A database index is a data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table at the cost of additional writes and storage space to maintain the index data structure. Indexes are used to quickly locate data without having to search every row in a database table every time a database table is accessed.</p>
<h5>ACID property</h5>
<p>In computer science, ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) is a set of properties of database transactions intended to guarantee validity even in the event of errors, power failures, etc. </p>
<h5>Summarization</h5>
<p>Summarization is a key data mining concept which involves techniques for find- ing a compact description of a dataset. Simple summarization methods such as. tabulating the mean and standard deviations are often applied for data analy- sis, data visualization and automated report generation.</p>
